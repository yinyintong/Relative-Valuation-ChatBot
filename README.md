# Relative-Valuation-Chatbot
This project presents a unique application of large language models in refining company relative valuation approaches, with a focus on its implementation in investment banking. By leveraging advanced language models, it builds an automated system that identifies relevant peer companies based on a candidate company's description. The system comprehends extensive data, generating a comprehensive and objective list of similar companies for valuation in seconds. This application has the potential to revolutionize traditional approaches, improving efficiency, objectivity, and accuracy in investment banking processes.
